We experiment different type of model LDA-QDA and SVM and Tree-Based. We found the highest accuracy from three models: hyper-tuned boosting model, SVM with power transformation, Ensembling svm rf and logistic regression.
And then we use ensemble approach to combine the result from these three model to predict final result.
